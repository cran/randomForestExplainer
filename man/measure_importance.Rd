\title{Importance of variables in a random forest}
\usage{
measure_importance(forest, mean_sample = "top_trees", measures = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{forest}{A random forest produced by the function randomForest with option localImp = TRUE}

\item{mean_sample}{The sample of trees on which mean minimal depth is calculated, possible values are "all_trees", "top_trees", "relevant_trees"}

\item{measures}{A vector of names of importance measures to be calculated - if equal to NULL then all are calculated; if "p_value" is to be calculated then "no_of_nodes" will be too}
}
\value{
A data frame with rows corresponding to variables and columns to various measures of importance of variables
}
\description{
Get a data frame with various measures of importance of variables in a random forest
}
\examples{
forest <- randomForest::randomForest(Species ~ ., data = iris, localImp = TRUE, ntree = 300)
measure_importance(forest)

}
